1. We made presentation about what we did during last week:
   Server Side, Zenhub transfer, Mockups, Requirements Document.
1. Feedbacks about reuirements made by instructor:
   Requirements need to be categorized. Please look at issue: [Issue#21] (https://github.com/bogaziciswe/b.w.a.t/issues/21)
1. Milestones need to be more clear, description and deliverables should be added for every milestone.
1. Plan should be ready for next week.
1. Feedbacks about personel logs made by instructor:
   Estimated and actual time for each task should be shown.
1. Folder structure should be camelCase ( As we discussed ) I created [an issue](https://github.com/bogaziciswe/b.w.a.t/issues/24) and self-assigned it.
1. Completeness and Consistency of the requirements should be assured. I have created [an issue](https://github.com/bogaziciswe/b.w.a.t/issues/25) about requirement validations.
1. There should be a milestone just for *our company* which is taken seriously, after having a sound plan we shall determine a milestone to see how well we are doing and what we are lacking and what is accomplished.
1. JSON LD mapping control is essential, we must prioritize our milestones to check that we understood JSON mapping correctly. I have created [a client-side issue](https://github.com/bogaziciswe/b.w.a.t/issues/26) and [a server side issue](https://github.com/bogaziciswe/b.w.a.t/issues/27) about this.
